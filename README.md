It is an amazing project to test your typing skills!
I have worked so hard on this project! like 13 hours!! this project is basically to test your typing skills. In this project players are given some random words and have 30 seconds to type maximum words they can write. After 30 seconds timer will be over and show your average words per minute (WPM) and final score. If you think this was not your best then you can also restart and try again! Disclamer: this will not run in online compiler only on Python,Pycharm,VS code etc. (need to install libraries in the code )
